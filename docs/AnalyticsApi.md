You can use the aggregations `count`, `rate`, and `total` with the `play` metric. - `start` is the number of times playback was started. You can use the aggregation `count` with this metric. - `end` is the number of times playback has ended with the content watch until the end. You can use the aggregation `count` with this metric. - `impression` is the number of times your content has been loaded and was ready for playback. You can use the aggregation `count` with this metric. - `impression-time` is the time in milliseconds that your content was loading for until the first video frame is displayed. You can use the aggregations `average` and `sum` with this metric. - `watch-time` is the cumulative time in seconds that the user has spent watching your content. You can use the aggregations `average` and `sum` with this metric. 
    aggregation = "count" # str | Use this path parameter to define a way of collecting data for the metric that you want analytics for.  - `count` returns the overall number of events for the `play` metric. - `rate` returns the ratio that calculates the number of plays your content receives divided by its impressions. This aggregation can be used only with the `play` metric. - `total` calculates the total number of events for the `play` metric.  - `average` calculates an average value for the selected metric. - `sum` adds up the total value of the select metric.

You can serialize filters in your query to receive more detailed breakdowns of your analytics.  - If you do not set a value for `filterBy`, the API returns the full dataset for your project. - The API only accepts the `mediaId` and `mediaType` filters when you call `/data/metrics/play/total` or `/data/buckets/play-total/media-id`.  These are the available breakdown dimensions:  - `mediaId`: Returns analytics based on the unique identifiers of a video or a live stream. - `mediaType`: Returns analytics based on the type of content. Possible values: `video` and `live-stream`.  - `continent`: Returns analytics based on the viewers' continent. The list of supported continents names are based on the [GeoNames public database](https://www.geonames.org/countries/). You must use the ISO-3166 alpha2 format, for example `EU`.

Response values can include: `computer`, `phone`, `tablet`, `tv`, `console`, `wearable`, `unknown`. - `operatingSystem`: Returns analytics based on the operating system used by the viewers. Response values can include `windows`, `mac osx`, `android`, `ios`, `linux`. - `browser`: Returns analytics based on the browser used by the viewers. Response values can include `chrome`, `firefox`, `edge`, `opera`. - `tag`: Returns analytics for videos using this tag. This filter only accepts a single value and is case sensitive.

# **get_metrics_over_time**
> AnalyticsMetricsOverTimeResponse get_metrics_over_time(metric)

Retrieve metrics over time

Retrieve countable metrics like the number of plays or impressions, grouped by the time at which they occurred

### Example

```python
import apivideo
from apivideo.api import analytics_api
from apivideo.model.too_many_requests import TooManyRequests
from apivideo.model.unrecognized_request_url import UnrecognizedRequestUrl
from apivideo.model.analytics_metrics_over_time_response import AnalyticsMetricsOverTimeResponse
from apivideo.model.filter_by2 import FilterBy2
from apivideo.model.analytics_plays400_error import AnalyticsPlays400Error
from pprint import pprint

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with apivideo.AuthenticatedApiClient(__API_KEY__) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = analytics_api.AnalyticsApi(api_client)
    metric = "play" # str | Use this path parameter to select a metric that you want analytics for.  - `play` is the number of times your content has been played. - `play-rate` is the ratio that calculates the number of plays your content receives divided by its impressions. - `start` is the number of times playback was started. - `end` is the number of times playback has ended with the content watch until the end. - `impression` is the number of times your content has been loaded and was ready for playback. 
    _from = dateutil_parser('2024-02-05T00:00:00+01:00') # datetime | Use this query parameter to define the starting date-time of the period you want analytics for.  - If you do not set a value for `from`, the default assigned value is 1 day ago, based on the `to` parameter. - The maximum value is 30 days ago. - The value you provide should follow the ATOM date-time format: `2024-02-05T00:00:00+01:00`  (optional)
    to = dateutil_parser('2024-02-06T00:00:00+01:00') # datetime | Use this query parameter to define the ending date-time of the period you want analytics for.  - If you do not set a value for `to`, the default assigned value is `now`. - The value for `to` is a non-inclusive value: the API returns data **before** the date-time that you set.  (optional)
    interval = "hour" # str | Use this query parameter to define how granularity of the data. Possible values: `hour`, `day`.  - Default: If no interval specified and the period (different between from and to) ≤ 2 days then hour, otherwise day.  - If you do not set a value for `interval`, and the period you set using the `from` and `to` parameters is less than or equals to 2 days, then the default assigned value is `hour`. Otherwise the API sets it to `day`.  (optional)

    } # FilterBy2 | Use this parameter to filter the API's response based on different data dimensions. You can serialize filters in your query to receive more detailed breakdowns of your analytics.  - If you do not set a value for `filterBy`, the API returns the full dataset for your project. - The API only accepts the `mediaId` and `mediaType` filters when you call `/data/metrics/play/total` or `/data/buckets/play-total/media-id`.  These are the available breakdown dimensions:  - `mediaId`: Returns analytics based on the unique identifiers of a video or a live stream. - `mediaType`: Returns analytics based on the type of content. Possible values: `video` and `live-stream`.  - `continent`: Returns analytics based on the viewers' continent. The list of supported continents names are based on the [GeoNames public database](https://www.geonames.org/countries/). You must use the ISO-3166 alpha2 format, for example `EU`. Possible values are: `AS`, `AF`, `NA`, `SA`, `AN`, `EU`, `AZ`.  - `country`: Returns analytics based on the viewers' country. The list of supported country names are based on the [GeoNames public database](https://www.geonames.org/countries/). You must use the ISO-3166 alpha2 format, for example `FR`. - `deviceType`: Returns analytics based on the type of device used by the viewers. Response values can include: `computer`, `phone`, `tablet`, `tv`, `console`, `wearable`, `unknown`. - `operatingSystem`: Returns analytics based on the operating system used by the viewers. Response values can include `windows`, `mac osx`, `android`, `ios`, `linux`. - `browser`: Returns analytics based on the browser used by the viewers. Response values can include `chrome`, `firefox`, `edge`, `opera`. - `tag`: Returns analytics for videos using this tag. This filter only accepts a single value and is case sensitive. Read more about tagging your videos [here](https://docs.api.video/vod/tags-metadata).  (optional)
